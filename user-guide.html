        <h2>Step One</h2>
        <p>Press down on the front tab of your camera located just above the photo printing slot to open the film compartment. Slide the new set of film into the compartment until you hear a click. You will then see the dark slide on the top of the film stack begin to eject from the photo printing slot on the front of the camera. This was only there to protect the sheets of film underneath from being exposed to light. You can now discard the dark slide. .</p>

        <h2>Step Two</h2>
        <p>You are now ready to turn on your camera. Locate the large round button on the back of the camera next to the eye piece and give it a firm press. You should see multiple lights on top of the camera illuminate, indicating that you have film inserted into the camera, which you just completed in the previous step. Once the camera is on, you can adjust the exposure by sliding the orange slider on the front of the camera, which is located to the left of the lens. Sliding the tab to the ‘plus’ sign will increase the brightness of your photo, ideal for darker conditions. Sliding the tab to the ‘minus’ sign will decrease the brightness of your photo, ideal for a bright environment. Leaving the slider in the middle position between plus and minus will leave the exposure in automatic mode. Since this is a beginners tutorial, we recommend keeping the slider at this setting until you have a few photos under your belt.</p>

        <h2>Step Three</h2>
        <p> Now for the most exciting part; taking your first picture! Simply find a subject of interest and point the camera in the direction of what you desire to take a photo of. Put one eye up against the viewfinder to align your shot. Closing your other eye can help with obtaining a clearer view. Once your subject is in frame how you want, click the red button on the front right-hand side of the camera once. You have just taken your first photo. You will see it begin to eject from the printing slot on the front of the camera. Once the picture has fully printed, avoid touching the actual image portion of the print. Grab the photo from the white borders to avoid getting oils from your fingers on the image. Put the photo in a dark place and let it develop for around 15 minutes. And finally, do NOT shake it like a polaroid picture; no matter what Andre from Outkast might tell you. This can ruin the photo in the development process. After the 15 minutes for development is up, you will have your very first polaroid picture!</p>
